        <p>In my free time, I enjoy skiing and climbing in the beautiful mountains of my hometown, Sion, in Valais, Switzerland. I also love spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking, mountain biking, or simply soaking up the sunshine and fresh air. As an agronomist, I am deeply committed to protecting and preserving the environment, and I pay close attention to how I consume and live in a way that is sustainable and eco-friendly. I am an avid reader and enjoy delving into books that focus on sustainability and environmental issues. I am also a music lover and enjoy playing the piano and singing. In addition to these interests, I am actively involved in various volunteer and community service projects, as I believe it is important to give back and make a positive impact on the world around us.</p>
